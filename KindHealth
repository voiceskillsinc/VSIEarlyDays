          "answer": "Most short-term plans limit your coverage to a maximum of 12 months at a time, or less. And most short-term health insurance companies will limit how many times you can repurchase coverage in a row. \nIt’s possible to be declined based on your medical history, so if you get sick and then need to re-apply for coverage under a new short-term plan, you may be out of luck. \nYou’ll also miss out on the richer benefits provided by major medical health insurance plans that meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act. \nDon’t treat short-term coverage like a long-term solution.

There are several different types of managed-care health insurance plans. These include HMO, PPO, and POS plans. Managed-care plans typically make use of healthcare provider networks. Healthcare providers within a network agree to perform services for managed-care plan patients at pre-negotiated rates and will usually submit the claim to the insurance company for you. In general, you'll have less paperwork and lower out-of-pocket costs with a managed care health insurance plan and a broader choice of healthcare providers with an indemnity plan.",

Under an Indemnity plan, you may see whatever doctors or specialists you like, with no referrals required. However, this kind of freedom will cost you.

Put broadly, the major differences concern choice of dental care providers, out-of-pocket costs and how bills are paid. Typically, Indemnity plans offer a broader selection of dental care providers than managed-care plans. Indemnity plans pay their share of the costs for covered services only after they receive a bill (which means that you may have to pay up front and then obtain reimbursement from your insurance company). Managed-care plans typically maintain dental provider networks. Dentists participating in a network agree to perform services for patients at pre-negotiated rates and usually will submit the claim to the dental insurance company for you. In general, you'll have less paperwork and lower out-of-pocket costs with a managed-care dental plan and a broader choice of dentists with an Indemnity plan.",
